# Anki-Partydrive
 An attempt to interface with Anki Overdrive from c# using the unity engine

This project uses InTheHand.BluetoothLE to connect to the Anki Overdrive cars. 

The project aims to create a c# server that can manage and control the cars.
And a Unity game client that will show a 3D representation of the cars and the track. as well as control the game flow (using controllers for local multiplayer)
